Hi, my self Harkesh.
Here is my assignment.
I have used react app to build this project.
To build and deploy this all we need to do is-
Open our Project folder in integrated terminal of Vs code.
Type a Command "npm run build".
Then it will take some time and a new folder will be created.
I have used Netlify to deploy my project beacuse its very easy to do so.
For that just google Netlify and Login there with github account or with other way.
Then just find a option called add new website.
Then just drag and drop your build folder in drop section of netlify.
wait for sometime and refresh your webpage.
You will have your website link
Thanks a lot.... :)
